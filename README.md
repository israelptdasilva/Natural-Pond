# Natural Pond

The idea to build a pond came about in 2015 when I watched [David Pagan's](https://www.youtube.com/@organicpools-davidpaganbutler/videos) videos on youtube. Back then, I didn't quite had the courage to dig a massive piece of land, nor did I have enough money to spend on something I could not control + z if things went wrong. Fast forward almost a decade, I got more confident, made a substantial amount of cash to throw at this personal project, and had the do now rather than live with regreat mindset. In this repo I want to archive and share my experience building a pond, show the results and maybe make you want to build a pond yourself.
